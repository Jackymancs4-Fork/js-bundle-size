# Javascript Bundle Size Cross-Browser Extension

Frontend developers frequently face the problem of choosing a proper library with a minimal footprint. [bundlephobia](https://bundlephobia.com) helps greatly by building bundles and providing their sizes minified and gzipped.

This cross-browser extension takes the next step, automatically requesting this data and adding it to:
* npm as a part of the right sidebar

* github at the top of the readme page

Tested in Google Chrome 71 and Mozilla Firefox 64.0.2 on macOS 10.14.
